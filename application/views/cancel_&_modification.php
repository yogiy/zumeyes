			<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

			<div class="content clearfix">

				<p>Hello, and thanks for visiting! Which does business as Zumeyes, operates and provides services through www.zumeyes.com (the “Site”), the Zumeyes mobile app (the “App”), and our retail locations. We’ll go by “Zumeyes”, “we”, or “us” to keep it simple. We know these types of documents can get pretty dense, but we want you to read this, so we’ll do our best to keep it easy to read. We will also refer to the Site, the App, our retail locations, and the services available through them as the “Services.” These Terms of Use do not apply to your use of our Prescription Check mobile application or our in-store Prescription Check service. You can find the Terms of Use that apply to Prescription Check here.</p>
				<p>Before using any of the Services, please read these Terms of Use (these “Terms”), our Privacy Policy, and any other policies and notices on the Site, on the App, or in any of our retail locations. Collectively, these materials contain terms, rules, and other guidelines related to your use of the Services. As a condition to your access to or use of the Services, you consent to be bound by these Terms, so please do not use the Services if you do not agree with all of these Terms. Some parts of the Services may have other terms, guidelines, or rules, and if you use those parts, those additional terms will also apply. Your use of the Services, and our provision of the Services to you, constitutes an agreement between you and Warby Parker to be bound by each of the terms, guidelines, and rules incorporated into these Terms. Because these Terms are legally binding, we want to make sure you understand them (like really understand them), so if you have any questions, contact us at legal@zumeyes.com.</p>

				<h3>1. We Reserve the Right to Update and Revise These Terms of Use at Any Time</h3>
				<p>Things happen quickly, both inside and outside of Zumeyes, so we will sometimes review these Terms to make sure they accurately reflect developments in current law and our business operations. We reserve the right to update and revise these Terms at any time upon 7 days’ notice. We’ll provide notice by changing the “Effective Date” at the top of this page so you can tell if these Terms have changed since your last visit. Please review these Terms regularly because 7 days after we post any changes, your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

				<h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
				<p>We only permit individuals who are at least 18 years old and can form legally binding contracts to use the Services. However, even non-adults deserve fantastic eyewear. You can use the Services if you are under 18, but only if you are at least 13 years old and only if a parent or legal guardian who is at least 18 years old supervises you. In all cases, the adult will be the user and is responsible for any and all activity. If you are younger than 13 years old, you may not use the Services (although your parents can still buy glasses for you.</p>

				<p>Your use of the Services means you represent and warrant that you meet all eligibility requirements we outline in these Terms. However, we may refuse to let certain people access or use the Services. We may also change our eligibility criteria.</p>

				<p>We offer the Services only for personal, noncommercial use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party (unless you are a parent or legal guardian using the Services for your minor child).</p>

				<h3>3. Privacy</h3>
				<p>Our Privacy Policy details how we collect and use your information. Please review it if you would like to know more about how we collect and use your information.</p>

				<h3>4. Your Account</h3>
				<p>You may be able to navigate some of the Services without creating a user account (”Account”); but certain Services (like making a purchase or ordering a Home Try-On) will require you to create an Account. If you create an Account, you are solely responsible for any activity that occurs through your Account. In order for us to provide you the best possible service, you agree to provide us with complete, accurate, and updated information for your Account at all times. If any information is incorrect or outdated, it can lead to errors or delays, for which we will not be responsible.</p>

				<p>You can share a good book, a nice walk, or even a pair of (non-prescription) glasses. You should not, however, share your Account information. And you shouldn’t use another person’s Account or registration information for the Services without permission. Similarly, no one else should be able to use your Account without permission. You are solely responsible for keeping your Account and Account password secure and for any consequence resulting from your failure to do so. You should never publish, distribute, or post login information for your Account.</p>

				<p>You can always delete the personal information from your Account by emailing us at privacy@zumeyes.com. </p>

				<h3>5.Right to Use the Services</h3>
				<p>After all of the restrictions above, we don’t want it to sound like you can’t even use the Services, so we’ll give you permission right here: subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, you have the right to access and use the Services solely for your personal, non-commercial use. This right will allow you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as we provide them, in the manner we permit through these Terms. We don’t think you would need to do much else.</p>

				<p>Subject to your complete and ongoing compliance with these Terms, you also have the right to use one copy of the App downloaded directly from Warby Parker or from a legitimate marketplace (such as Apple’s iTunes store), solely in object code format, for your personal, non-commercial use on a single compatible mobile device that you own or control, for the purpose of accessing and using the Services in accordance with these Terms. The term App, as used in these Terms, includes any update or modification to the App that we make available to you (unless we provide you with separate terms when making the update or modification available).</p>

				<p>If you are prohibited under applicable law from using the App or the Services, you may not use them.</p>
